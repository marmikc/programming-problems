# programming-problems
Repository for me to work through programming problems.

Including the implementations of the problems, I've tried to create test files that test the implementation with randomly generated numbers, against a naive solution, or an answer key.

## binary-index-tree
Binary indexed trees can help when needing to return sums of consecutive elements in an array while also supporting fast updating of values within the array.

## python-linked-list
I've never quite used linked lists in python, so I created a small exercise to do so and explore the problem of getting the nth last element in a linked list of an unknown size.

## longest-path
I received this problem as a question in a technical interview and floundered in my solution and my answer. I am tackling it here so as to  present my best solution.

## random-weighted-shuffle
This is a problem that has intruiged me for a while. Given a list of items with weights, how do you efficiently shuffle the list?

## cache-replacement-policies
When I took operating systems we learned about the least recently used (LRU) cache and the clock page replacement algorithms. I wanted to implement them and play around with them. This contians my implementation of both and test files that I wrote.
